# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Test Commands

All commands run from the respective project directory.

```bash
# Build the library
cd src && dotnet build

# Run all unit tests
cd test/Unit && dotnet test

# Run a single test class
cd test/Unit && dotnet test --filter "ClassName=Test_InMemory_ReplayAttack"

# Run a single test method
cd test/Unit && dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~MethodName"

# Run with coverage
cd test/Unit && dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

The library targets `net8.0` and `net10.0`. Integration tests (`test/Integration`) require a running Redis instance on the default port.

## Architecture Overview

HmacManager is an ASP.NET Core HMAC authentication library. It supports both server-side request verification and client-side request signing via `HttpClient`. The two primary integration paths are:

1. **Server (verifying)**: Register via `services.AddHmacManager(...)` + `builder.AddHmac(...)`. Requests are validated by `HmacAuthenticationHandler` (in `src/Mvc/`).
2. **Client (signing)**: Register via `httpClientBuilder.AddHmacHttpMessageHandler(...)`. `HmacDelegatingHandler` signs outgoing requests automatically.

### Core signing flow

`IHmacManager` (`src/Components/HmacManager.cs`) is the central type. `SignAsync(HttpRequestMessage)` creates an `Hmac`, computes a signature, and attaches headers. `VerifyAsync(HttpRequestMessage)` parses incoming headers, recomputes the signature, and compares.

Signature computation lives in `HmacSignatureProvider` → `HmacFactory` → hash generators in `src/Components/Hashing/Generators/`. The signing content string (method + URI + date + public key + content hash + scheme header values + nonce) is built by implementations of `ISigningContentBuilder`.

### Policies and schemes

- **`HmacPolicy`** (`src/Policies/`) is the top-level configuration unit: it holds `KeyCredentials`, hash `Algorithms`, an optional `Nonce` cache config, and a `SchemeCollection`.
- **`Scheme`** (`src/Schemes/`) is a named set of required HTTP headers whose values are included in the signature, enabling scoped authentication contexts.
- Policies are stored in `IHmacPolicyCollection`, which is registered as either singleton (static) or scoped (dynamic/DB-driven).

### Nonce caching

`INonceCache` (`src/Caching/`) prevents replay attacks by storing used nonces with a TTL. Two implementations exist: `MemoryNonceCache` (in-process) and `DistributedNonceCache` (Redis). The `Nonce` config on a policy selects which to use.

### DI wiring

`IServiceCollectionExtensions.AddHmacManager()` (`src/Mvc/Extensions/`) registers all internal services. `IHmacManagerFactory` is the DI-resolvable entry point to obtain an `IHmacManager` for a named policy at runtime.

### Key types at a glance

| Type | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IHmacManager` | `src/Components/Interfaces/` | Sign / verify requests |
| `IHmacManagerFactory` | `src/Components/Interfaces/` | Resolve manager by policy name |
| `HmacPolicy` | `src/Policies/` | Top-level auth configuration |
| `Scheme` | `src/Schemes/` | Named header set included in signature |
| `HmacResult` | `src/Components/` | Result of sign/verify (success + `Hmac` snapshot) |
| `HmacDelegatingHandler` | `src/Mvc/` | Auto-signs outgoing `HttpClient` requests |
| `HmacAuthenticationHandler` | `src/Mvc/` | ASP.NET Core auth scheme handler |
| `HmacEvents` | `src/Mvc/` | Hooks: `OnValidateKeys`, `OnAuthSuccess`, `OnAuthFailure` |

### Test layout

Tests mirror the source structure under `test/Unit/`. Shared test data and helpers are in `test/Unit/Common/`. The `src` project exposes internals to the `Unit` project via `InternalsVisibleTo`.

## CI/CD Pipelines

All pipelines are defined under `.github/workflows/`. Dependabot is configured separately at `.github/dependabot.yml`.

### `pr.yml` — PR Validation

**File**: `.github/workflows/pr.yml`

**Trigger**: Any pull request opened or updated targeting `main` or `develop`.

**Purpose**: Gate merges by verifying the full test suite passes. Runs unit and integration tests as parallel jobs so a failure in one does not block feedback from the other.

**Jobs**:

#### `unit-tests`
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Installs .NET `8.0.x` and `10.0.x` (matching the library's target frameworks).
3. Restores dependencies in `test/Unit`.
4. Builds `test/Unit`.
5. Runs the unit test suite via `dotnet test`.

#### `integration-tests`
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Starts a Redis 7 instance using `supercharge/redis-github-action`.
3. Pings Redis to confirm it is accepting connections before proceeding.
4. Installs .NET `8.0.x` and `10.0.x`.
5. Restores dependencies in `test/Integration`.
6. Builds `test/Integration`.
7. Runs the integration test suite via `dotnet test`.

**Branch protection**: Both the `Unit Tests` and `Integration Tests` checks should be required to pass in GitHub → Settings → Branches for `main` and `develop` before a PR can be merged.

### `release.yml` — Pack and Publish to NuGet

**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

**Trigger**: Any push to a branch matching the pattern `release/**`.

**Purpose**: Validate the release candidate and publish the NuGet package. The version is derived from the branch name, making it explicit and auditable without requiring commit message conventions.

**Branch naming convention**: Release branches must follow the pattern `release/vX.Y.Z` (e.g., `release/v2.7.0`). The pipeline validates this format and fails immediately if it does not match, preventing a misnamed branch from triggering a publish.

**Jobs**:

#### `test`
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Starts a Redis 7 instance and verifies it is running.
3. Installs .NET `8.0.x` and `10.0.x`.
4. Runs the full unit test suite (`test/Unit`).
5. Runs the full integration test suite (`test/Integration`).

#### `publish` (runs only if `test` passes)
1. Checks out the repository with full git history (`fetch-depth: 0`).
2. Extracts the semantic version from the branch name by stripping the `release/v` prefix. Validates the result matches `X.Y.Z` and exits with an error if not.
3. Installs .NET `8.0.x` and `10.0.x`.
4. Packs the library in Release configuration with the extracted version: `dotnet pack --configuration Release -p:Version=X.Y.Z`.
5. Pushes the `.nupkg` to NuGet Gallery using `dotnet nuget push`. The `--skip-duplicate` flag prevents failure if the version was already published (safe to re-run).

**Required secret**: `NUGET_API_KEY` must be set in GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions. Obtain this from nuget.org → Account → API Keys. Scope the key to the `HmacManager` package with push-only permissions.

**Branch protection**: The `Test` job check should be required to pass in GitHub → Settings → Branches for the `release/**` pattern. This prevents force-pushes to release branches and ensures tests are always green before the `publish` job is allowed to run.

**Typical workflow**:
```bash
# Create and push a release branch — the pipeline triggers automatically
git checkout -b release/v2.7.0
git push origin release/v2.7.0
```

### `codeql.yml` — Static Security Analysis

**File**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Any pull request targeting `main` or `develop`.
- Weekly on Monday at midnight UTC (scheduled via cron: `0 0 * * 1`).

**Purpose**: Detect security vulnerabilities and code quality issues in C# using GitHub's CodeQL engine. Free for public repositories. Results appear in GitHub → Security → Code scanning alerts.

**Job**: `analyze`
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Initializes the CodeQL analyzer for the `csharp` language.
3. Installs .NET `8.0.x` and `10.0.x`.
4. Builds the library (`src/`) so CodeQL can trace the compiled output.
5. Runs the CodeQL analysis and uploads results to GitHub Security.

**Required permissions**: The job declares `security-events: write` so it can upload findings to the Security tab. No secrets required — this uses the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Dependabot — Automated Dependency Updates

**File**: `.github/dependabot.yml`

**Purpose**: Automatically open pull requests when dependencies are out of date, keeping the project current without manual monitoring. PRs raised by Dependabot go through the normal `pr.yml` validation before they can be merged.

**Update targets**:

| Ecosystem | Directory | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| NuGet packages | `/` | Weekly |
| GitHub Actions | `/` | Weekly |

NuGet updates cover packages declared in `src/HmacManager.csproj` (e.g., `System.Runtime.Caching`). GitHub Actions updates cover the action versions pinned across all workflow files (e.g., `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-dotnet`, `supercharge/redis-github-action`).
